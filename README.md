This project was based off the Dex Explorer by Moon, which if didn't exist our project wouldn't have been possible.
Polyspector is to stay free forever with lots of features offered to you at no price.

# What language is this project made in?
> We are made in Moonsharp, which is a C# interpreter for LUA that Polytoria currently supports.

# What is this project about?
> Polyspector is a open-source project that is a search engine for objects in a Polytoria game. We allow you to view Polytoria scripts with ease, change Properties of objects, and much more as it is like in Polytoria's equivalent to Roblox Studio.

# How can you use?
> Currently, Polyspector doesn't support any type of "DLL injection" that allows you to execute LUA code, but we recommend ```Elytra```, a great Moonsharp tool for executing Polyspector inside of Polytoria ❤️
